# gamstransfer

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

GAMS Transfer is a package to maintain GAMS data outside a GAMS script
in a programming language like Python, Matlab or R. It allows the user
to add GAMS symbols (Sets, Aliases, Parameters, Variables and
Equations), to manipulate GAMS symbols, as well as read/write symbols to
different data endpoints. GAMS Transferâ€™s main focus is the highly
efficient transfer of data between GAMS and the target programming
language, while keeping those operations as simple as possible for the
user. In order to achieve this, symbol records - the actual and
potentially large-scale data sets - are stored in native data structures
of the corresponding programming languages. The benefits of this
approach are threefold: (1) The user is usually very familiar with these
data structures, (2) these data structures come with a large tool box
for various data operations, and (3) optimized methods for reading from
and writing to GAMS can transfer the data as a bulk - resulting in the
high performance of this package.

## Quick Start Guide

To install `gamstransfer` from GitHub, install the released version of
`remotes` package from CRAN.

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
```

You can then install a particular release of `gamstransfer` from GitHub
using the following command.

``` r
remotes::install_github("GAMS-dev/gtr/gamstransfer@vX.Y.Z")
```

To use `gamstransfer`, load the package using `library(gamstransfer)`.
Following is the code snippet to read data from a GDX file named
`foo.gdx`.

``` r
library(gamstransfer)
m = Container$new("foo.gdx")
```

## Dependencies

gamstransfer depends on the following R packages:

  - R6
  - collections
  - Rcpp
  - R.utils

To build this package from source, the following libraries must be
installed:

  - zlib

## Install a particular release

It is recommended that the users install released versions of
`gamstransfer` using

``` r
remotes::install_github("GAMS-dev/gtr/gamstransfer@vX.Y.Z")
```

To use `gamstransfer`, all the R package dependencies can be installed
using the `install.packages` command. All the dependencies can be
installed at once using the following command.

``` r
install.packages(c("R6", "collections", "Rcpp", "R.utils"))
```

## Install the development version

Installation from the development version is similar to installation
from the source. To install the development version, users need to point
the installer to the `zlib` library dependency. There are a couple ways
to do it.

1.  You can add `zlib` to your system environment variable `PATH`. This
    is the easier and the recommended way. One can then install
    `gamstransfer` using the following command.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
remotes::install_github("GAMS-dev/gtr/gamstransfer")
```

2.  You can manually point the installer to `zlib` using
    `configure.vars` argument. An example is shown below.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
remotes::install_github("GAMS-dev/gtr/gamstransfer@vX.Y.Z", configure.vars=c("INCLUDE_DIR='[path_to_include]' LIB_DIR='[path_to_bin]'"))
```

or

``` r
remotes::install_github("GAMS-dev/gtr/gamstransfer@vX.Y.Z", configure.vars=c("LIB_DIR='[path_to_shared_object]'"))
```

3.  One can also set `LIB_DIR` and `INCLUDE_DIR` permanently in the
    .Renviron file
