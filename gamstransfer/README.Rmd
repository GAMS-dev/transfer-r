GAMS Transfer is a package to maintain GAMS data outside a GAMS script
 in a programming language like Python, Matlab or R. It allows the user
to add GAMS symbols (Sets, Aliases, Parameters, Variables and Equations),
 to manipulate GAMS symbols, as well as read/write symbols to different
data endpoints. GAMS Transfer's main focus is the highly efficient transfer
 of data between GAMS and the target programming language, while keeping
those operations as simple as possible for the user. In order to achieve this,
 symbol records - the actual and potentially large-scale data sets - are
stored in native data structures of the corresponding programming languages.
The benefits of this approach are threefold: (1) The user is usually very
familiar with these data structures, (2) these data structures come with a
large tool box for various data operations, and (3) optimized methods for
reading from and writing to GAMS can transfer the data as a bulk - resulting
 in the high performance of this package.

## Quick Start Guide
To install `gamstransfer` from GitHub, install the released version of `remotes`
package from CRAN.

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
```

You can then install a particular release of `gamstransfer` from GitHub using the
following command.

``` r
remotes::install_github("GAMS-dev/gtr/gamstransfer@vX.Y.Z")
```

To use `gamstransfer`, load the package using `library(gamstransfer)`. Following
is the code snippet to read data from a GDX file named `foo.gdx`.

``` r
library(gamstransfer)
m = Container$new("foo.gdx")
```

## Installation

You can install the development version of gamstransfer like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(gamstransfer)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
