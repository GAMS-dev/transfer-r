Description: GAMS Transfer is a package to maintain GAMS data outside a GAMS
     script in a programming language like Python, Matlab or R. It
     allows the user to add GAMS symbols (Sets, Aliases, Parameters,
     Variables and Equations), to manipulate GAMS symbols, as well as
     read/write symbols to different data endpoints. GAMS Transfer's
     main focus is the highly efficient transfer of data between GAMS
     and the target programming language, while keeping those
     operations as simple as possible for the user. In order to achieve
     this, symbol records - the actual and potentially large-scale data
     sets - are stored in native data structures of the corresponding
     programming languages.  The benefits of this approach are
     threefold. (1) The user is usually very familiar with these data
     structures, (2) these data structures come with a large tool box
     for various data operations, and (3) optimized methods for reading
     from and writing to GAMS can transfer the data as a bulk -
     resulting in the high performance of this package.
