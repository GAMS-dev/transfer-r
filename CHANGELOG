GAMS Transfer R
==================
- Breaking: Symbol name uniqueness is now checked case insensitively. For
  example, it is not possible to have two different symbols named
  `symbol` and `Symbol` or `SYMBOL` anymore
- Added a method `Container$getSymbolNames` to return the original symbol names
  for a list of symbol names of any case
- Added a method `Container$hasSymbols` to check if symbol name (case insensitive)
  exists
- Changed `Container$getSymbols`, `Container$removeSymbols`,
  `Container$renameSymbol`, `Container$describe*` and others that use
  `Container$getSymbols` to accept symbol names case insensitively
