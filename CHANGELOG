GAMS Transfer R
==================
- Symbol method `isValid` now checks also for scalars with more than one record entries
- bug fix in symbol `description`
- added `isScalar` property for the symbols of type `Variable` and `Equation`
- Symbol method `getCardinality` is removed
- Updated symbol method `reorderUELs()`. If the argument `uels` is not passed UELs are reordered based on the records
- Symbol method `toDense()` now requires domain UELs and domain records to be in the same order and unused UELs in the domain (if any) at the end of the UEL list
- Fixed the display of long error messages
- bug fix in accessing Container symbols in a case-insensitive manner
- bug fix in the Container method `describeAliases`
- Container `read` preserves the domain type from the source and avoids domain linking by symbol name

GAMS Transfer R v1.16.0
==================
- added checks for singleton and multidimensional checksin `Symbol` method `isValid()`
- changed the default domain labels. User-specified domain labels are preserved if unique
- performance improvement in `Container` method `read`

GAMS Transfer R v1.14.0
==================
- Significant performance improvements to Container write method
- bug fix in Container read when reading a `Symbol` with unused UELs
- bug fix in `todense` method for `Symbol`

GAMS Transfer R v1.12.0
==================
- released for MacOS ARM64
- bug fix in writing empty container
- added `Symbol` method `copy` to copy symbol from one `Container` or `ConstContainer` to another `Container`
- added `Container` and `ConstContainer` method `copy` to copy symbols from to another
- bug fix in using ConstContainer Alias methods when the aliased parent set is absent

GAMS Transfer R v1.10.0
==================
- performance improvement in read
- Partial domain forwarding is now allowed by passing a logical vector as the `domainForwarding` argument
- `generateRecords` method for `Symbols` to automatically generate records

GAMS Transfer R v1.8.0
==================
- `removeSymbols` removes symbol links in other symbols
- added `symbols` argument to Container methods `renameUELs` and `removeUELs`
- `findDuplicateRecords` now returns a data frame instead of row indices
- Breaking: `Container` `data` field is now an ordered dictionary from `collections` package instead of named list. Instead of `m$data$<symbolname>`, use `m[<symbolname>]`.
- performance improvement to `Container` method `hasSymbols`. This results in significant speed-ups when adding multiple symbols to the Container.
- added `symbols` argument to `Container` methods `getDomainViolations`, `hasDomainViolations`, `countDomainViolations`, `dropDomainViolations`, `hasDuplicateRecords`, `countDuplicateRecords`, `dropDuplicateRecords`, `isValid`, and `write` for partial operation.
- `Container` method `getSymbols` now always returns a list
- added `equals` method to `Symbols` to check if symbols are equal
- bug fix in `SpecialValues$isNA`
- bug fix in `getUELs` for scalar symbols
- bug fix in `Symbol` method `isValid` for symbols containing only NA
- bug fix in `Variable` and `Equation` set records for numeric inputs
- added `equals` method for `Container` and `ConstContainer`

GAMS Transfer R v1.6.0
==================
- domain forwarding bug fix when the records are NULL
- describe* method bug fix when the type of symbol is not present in the Container
- added UniverseAlias symbol type for alias to the Universe
- renameUELs methods now have `allowMerge` argument for more data flexibility

GAMS Transfer R v1.4.0
==================
- Breaking: Symbol name uniqueness is now checked case insensitively. For
  example, it is not possible to have two different symbols named
  `symbol` and `Symbol` or `SYMBOL` anymore
- Added a method `Container$getSymbolNames` to return the original symbol names
  for a list of symbol names of any case
- Added a method `Container$hasSymbols` to check if symbol name (case insensitive)
  exists
- Changed `Container$getSymbols`, `Container$removeSymbols`,
  `Container$renameSymbol`, `Container$describe*` and others that use
  `Container$getSymbols` to accept symbol names case insensitively
- New Symbol methods `hasDuplicateRecords`, `countDuplicateRecords`, `findDuplicateRecords`, and `dropDuplicateRecords` to help debug and resolve errors with duplicate records
- New Container methods `hasDuplicateRecords`, `countDuplicateRecords`, and `dropDuplicateRecords` to help find symbols that contain duplicate records that cause the Symbol to be invalid
- Raises an exception if attempting to read a symbol that does not exist in the data source (previously symbol names were silently ignored)
- New tests within `Container$isValid()` method to detect broken container references in symbols and inconsistent symbol naming between the `<Container>$data` field and the symbol objects
- Breaking: Symbol records and symbol names are treated in a case insensitive manner. Symbols
 domain is not automaitcally checked
- isValid method does not check for symbol record domain columns being factors, for duplicates, and for domain violations
- New Symbol methods `hasDomainViolations`, `countDomainViolations`, `findDomainViolations`, `dropDomainViolations`, `getDomainViolations`
- New Container methods `hasDomainViolations`, `countDomainViolations`, `dropDomainViolations`
- bug fix in Alias record setter
- bug fix in `toDense()` method for Symbols with domaintype other than `regular`
- allowed symbol overwriting with `addSet/addParameter/addVariable/addEquation/addAlias` methods when everything other than records and description is unchanged
- Added methods `SpecialValues$isNA`, `SpecialValues$isEps`, `SpecialValues$isUndef`, `SpecialValues$isPosInf`, `SpcialValues$isNegInf` to test for SpecialValues
- bug fix in count* methods for multiple columns
- The argument for where* methods changed from `columns` to `column`
- Changing the symbol domain now changes column names of records data.frame accordingly
- removed dependence on the package `assertthat`
- automatically remove trailing whitespaces from UELs in `setRecords` and `*UEL` methods

GAMS Transfer R v1.0.0
==================
- added a new class ConstContainer for efficient data transfer
- allow read from Container/ConstContainer into another Container
- bug fix in listSets function that used to also list Aliases
- updated default_values in the Equation class
- updated Symbol isValid() method to check for levels of the linked domain set and symbol records
- bug fix in setting factor levels for subsets of subsets
- bug fix in countEPS method
- fixed record setter using non-dataframe object types for variables, equations, and parameters

GAMS Transfer R v0.2.0
==================
- released binary packages on Windows and MacOS
- bug fixes and improvements

GAMS Transfer R v0.1.0
==================
- first release
